### Key Changes Made:

* **Conciseness:** I removed redundant phrases and focused on the core achievements for each role.
* **Bullet Points:** I used bullet points to list the achievements, making them easier to read.
* **Stronger Action Verbs:** I used stronger action verbs to start each bullet point (e.g., "Managed," "Streamlined," "Implemented").
* **Focus on Impact:** I tried to highlight the impact of your actions (e.g., "improved efficiency," "ensured data integrity").

This revised version provides a more focused and impactful summary of your work experience while still showcasing the breadth of your skills and background.
